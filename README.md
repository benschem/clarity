# Clarity

A CLI tool that provides a zoomed out overview of your projects.

## Install

Symlink this script to your personal bin folder so it's available globally:

```bash
# Make the original script executable
chmod +x ~/code/benchem/clarity.rb

# Create a symlink to your ~/bin directory (assumes ~/bin is in your $PATH)
ln -s ~/code/benchem/clarity.rb ~/bin/clarity
```

Now you can run clarity from anywhere in your terminal.

## Usage

```bash
clarity help
```
