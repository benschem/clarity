# Clarity

A CLI tool that provides a zoomed out overview of your projects.

## Install

Install gems

```bash
bundle install
```

Symlink this script to your personal bin folder so it's available globally:

```bash
# Make the original script executable
chmod +x ~/code/benschem/clarity/bin/clarity

# Create a symlink to your ~/bin directory
ln -sf ~/code/benschem/clarity/bin/clarity ~/bin/clarity
```

Make sure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`

Now you can run clarity from anywhere in your terminal.

## Usage

```bash
clarity help
```
